<tr><td><a target=_blank href ="https://replicate.com/pixray/text2image">Pixray Text2Image</a></td><td>The OG AI Image Generator. This website displays the progress as an image is generated, AND you can scroll through all the past frames with a slider. I used this feature to (painfully) make .gifs out of a single prompt.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5">Stable Diffusion</a></td><td>The most popular website on this list. Produces up to 4 images, but can have a pretty long queue, if you're unlucky.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/diffuse-the-rest">Diffuse the Rest</a></td><td>You get to draw on a canvas to guide the ai to make what you want (You still need a prompt)</td></tr> 
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://craiyon.com">CrAIyon</a></td><td>Formerly known as "DALL-E Mini", this somewhat formerly viral website generates NINE images at a time*! AND, this site is the first one I found that knew what "among us" is! *(these images, however, are pretty low-resolution)</td></tr>
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shuang59/Composable-Diffusion">Composable Diffusion</a></td><td>Allows you to combine several prompts into one image, and control the weight of each prompt on the final image. If an error keeps appearing, you probably forgot to change the weights section after changing the number of prompts.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/kuprel/min-dalle">Min Dall-e</a></td><td>Basically CrAIon, but upgraded in every possible way except for the lack of dark mode. You can generate up to TWENTY FIVE images at one time, and it (on average) takes LESS TIME than CrAIon takes to generate nine. Plus it has settings for you to mess around with.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rothfeld/stable-diffusion-mat-outpainting-primer">Outpainting with Stable Diffusion</a></td><td>Allows you to upload an image, and the ai will try to extend it. However, the ai works a lot better with natural landscapes, and will tend to create mountains and forests from any arbitrary image.</td></tr>
